id="information-we-collect"></a>Information we collect<a class="hash-link" href="#information-we-collect" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>DLG is built of giving users control over their messaging and media that they share through their phone and other mobile devices to communicate.
We try to collect as little information as possible from our users and leave most of the decisions about their data privacy up to them. Our business model is significantly based on opt-in advertising, where users opt-in to receive information from brands they like and with whom users choose to interact.</p><p>When you sign-up for DLG, we ask you for your name, email address, and telephone number to help facilitate the usage of DLG. In addition, we collect the information you choose to share on DLG, such as when you send a message, upload photo, and perhaps video and audio files, or reply to a friend&#x27;s message. But you decide how this personal information is used and shared through DLG.</p><p>When you use DLG, we will also collect certain technical information, such as device identifier (but not the UDID), MAC address, device event information, such as crashes, system activity and hardware settings, as well as Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system, the browser type, your personally identifiable activity on DLG web site if you are accessing DLG through the browser. We also access your contact address book in order to identify your friends, facilitating your use of DLG as a social messaging tool. When this information is passed, encrypted, to our servers for processing. We only do this with your permission. We may also ask you to give location information and if you agree we add it to your media and messages. This is in order to enable later recall of messages based on time and place variables. We also access your photo and video gallery, with your permission, in order to permit you to use media from the gallery in DLG.</p><p>Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies - files the browser places on your computer. We may use both session cookies and understand how users interact with our services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our services, and to improve our services. No personally identifiable usage information will be kept for use by DLG except to enable your use of the DLG app. How the information we collect is used</p><p>We use the information collected through DLG for the following purposes:</p><ul><li>to provide, maintain, protect and improve services or information you request, and to process and complete any transactions;</li><li>to respond to your emails, submissions, questions, comments, requests, and complaints and provide customer service;</li><li>to send you security alerts, confirmations, and support messages and otherwise facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, our services;</li><li>to find and connect with your friends (when instructed by you)</li><li>for internal operations, including troubleshooting, testing, aggregate usage and data analysis and service improvement designed to increase the functionality and user friendliness of our services; and</li><li>for any other purpose for which the information was collected.</li><li>What information is shared with third parties</li></ul><p>We do not share the personal information we have collected from you with companies, organizations and individuals, except as described below:</p><ul><li>with your friends on DLG, connections from your address book or other connections with whom you choose to share your DLG messages;</li><li>with general public via DLG, when you chose to make your posts public;</li><li>with certain social networking services, when you chose such sharing through DLG;</li><li>with service providers who are working with us in connection with the operation of our site or our services, for example, data storage service providers. These service providers have access to your personal</li><li>information only to perform services on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose it or use it for any other purposes;</li><li>when you choose to provide us your consent to do so;</li><li>When we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:<ul><li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;</li><li>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations;</li><li>detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;</li><li>protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of DLG, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li></ul></li></ul><p>We may share aggregated information and non-personally identifiable information publicly and with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes, for example to show trends about the general use of our services.</p><p>If DLG is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p><p>We are not responsible for the actions of service providers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to any third parties.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="information-security"></a>Information security<a class="hash-link" href="#information-security" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>We work hard to protect DLG and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold.

Any other apps or uses tied to your personal cloud on DLG will also be affected. It typically takes a short time to delete an account, but some information may remain in backup copies and logs after deletion. You should only delete your account if you are sure you never want to reactivate it or access any information on your personal cloud at DLG. You can delete your account by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@ayya.com.tr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info@ayya.com.tr</a>.</p><p>Certain information may be needed to provide you with services, so we only delete this information after you delete your account. Some of the things you do using DLG are not stored in your account, like commenting on a photo or sending someone a message (where your friend may still have a message you sent, even after you delete your account). That information remains after you delete or deactivate your account.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="international-users"></a>International Users<a class="hash-link" href="#international-users" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>If you are located outside Turkey and choose to provide information to us, we may transfer your information to Turkey or other countries to process it there.
